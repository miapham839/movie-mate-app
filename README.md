A content-based movie recommender app built with Python and Streamlit. It suggests similar movies based on plot, genre, cast, keywords, and director, with posters pulled from the TMDb API.

### **Features** ##
- Suggests 5 similar movies for any selected title
- Uses TF-IDF + KNN (cosine similarity) for recommendations
- Fetches and displays real-time movie posters
- Interactive deployed web app interface with Streamlit


### **Project Files** ###
- movie_recommendation_system.ipynb: Data processing & model training
- app.py: Streamlit web app
- .pkl files: Saved vectorizer, model, and cleaned data


### **How I built this project** ###
1. Preprocessing: Merges movies and credits datasets. Cleans and combines text into a single tags column.
2. Modeling:
- Uses TfidfVectorizer to vectorize tags
- Trains KNN with cosine similarity
3. App: User selects a movie, and the app shows 5 similar titles with posters via the TMDb API.


### **Setup** ###
1. pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn streamlit requests
2. streamlit run app.py
3. Replace the hardcoded TMDb API key in app.py with your own.
